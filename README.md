# Node.js HTTPS Server Example
This is a simple example of setting up an HTTPS server using Node.js and Express. The server uses SSL certificates to establish a secure connection with clients.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (>=12.0.0)
npm (Node Package Manager)

## Required packages

    npm install https
    npm install fs
    npm install http

# SSL Certificates
For this example, self-signed SSL certificates are used. In a production environment, it's recommended to obtain SSL certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) for enhanced security.

## Add a private key and a certificate signing request (CSR)
## Add a self-signed certificate using the private key

    const options = {
    key: fs.readFileSync('./ssl.key'),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('./ssl.cert'),
    requestCert: true,
    rejectUnauthorized: false,
    };
